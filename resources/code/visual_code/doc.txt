bugs :
    bug#1. Doesnt require you to take the key only while reaching the key tile.Even if u press 'take key' button at first and walk over the key, it will be considered picked up.
    bug#2. While pressing 'try again' in the modal, the camera angle is changing.
    bug#3. closing modal doesn't reset player position.
